## v0.2.0 — 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **`solve` now integrates in native coordinates** on finite domains, skipping
  the `ChangeOfVariables` remap (`[lb, ub] → [-1, 1]` plus a Jacobian factor at
  every evaluation) that `Integrals.init` applies to every tuple-domain
  problem. Near the singular vertex the remapped coordinate is quantised at
  the machine spacing around −1, which distorted the singular subdivision
  geometry and could stall the extrapolation: `∫₀¹∫₀¹ (x·y)^(-1/2)` converges
  in 110 045 evaluations natively but exhausted a 10⁶ budget (returning
  `MaxIters`) through the remap, ~26× slower. `solve` results consequently
  change in their last bits (and occasionally in return code, for the better)
  relative to v0.1.x: **`solve` is now bit-for-bit identical to the
  Fortran-validated driver** on the six canonical Espelid–Genz cases.
  Measured on those cases: `(x·y)^(-1/2)` 95 ms → 3.6 ms with `MaxIters` →
  `Success`; `(x·y·z)^(-1/3)` and `-log(x·y)` ~3.3× faster; a ForwardDiff
  derivative through a singular integrand 110 ms → 4.8 ms with ~400× fewer
  allocations. Infinite domains keep the standard transformation path and
  behave exactly as before.

### Added

- **In-place integrands**: `IntegralFunction((y, u, p) -> …, prototype)` is
  now supported and is the zero-allocation route for vector integrands
  (`numfun` and the value type are read off the prototype; no probe
  evaluation). A singular two-component benchmark drops from 8.1 M
  allocations / 341 MB to 230 k / 10.7 MB per solve.
- `sol.stats.message`: human-readable description of the raw `ifail` code
  (`DECUHR.ifail_message`, unexported).
- **Bit-exact golden tests**: the six canonical cases are locked bit-for-bit
  (result, error estimate, `neval`, `ifail`) at both the driver and the
  `solve` level, so any change in the numerical path fails loudly. Test suite
  extended from 27 to 140 assertions (all previously untested `ifail` codes,
  automatic log-factor detection, 4-D rules, singular vector integrands,
  scalar-domain error, infinite-domain path).

### Performance

- `@inbounds` in the hot loops (rule evaluation, fully-symmetric sums, region
  heap) and value-typed accumulators in `_eval_rule!` (previously
  `Float64`-initialised and promoted to dual numbers under AD): core driver
  ~5–11 % faster on the canonical cases, bit-for-bit unchanged results
  (verified under `--check-bounds=yes` and `--check-bounds=no`).

### Removed

- Stale `.JuliaFormatter.toml` (blue style): the CI formatter is Runic.

## v0.1.3 — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Default parameter alignment with Fortran reference:** the default value of
  `wrksub` (maximum number of stored subregions) is increased from 5000 to
  50000 to match the original DECUHR Fortran implementation. This provides
  sufficient refinement budget by default for challenging 3-D singularities and
  other difficult cases. Users requiring smaller memory footprints may still
  pass `wrksub` explicitly.

### Documentation

- Updated examples and API documentation to reflect `wrksub=50000` as the new
  default.

## v0.1.2 — 2026-06-01

### Added

- `sol.stats` now exposes `numevals` (integrand-evaluation count) and `ifail`
  (raw DECUHR return code), useful in particular to interpret a `MaxIters`
  return code.
- Automatic differentiation through `solve` now works **even when `alpha` is
  auto-estimated**: the exponent is estimated on the primal integrand (it is a
  structural property of the singularity, independent of the differentiation
  seed) and the integration then proceeds in the dual-number type. Previously
  this combination returned `ifail = 14`.

### Changed

- **Performance:** `_fully_symmetric_sum!` (Fortran `DEFSHR`) no longer
  allocates a fresh generator copy and evaluation-point vector on every call;
  two caller-preallocated scratch buffers are threaded through instead. The
  result is **bit-for-bit identical**; allocations on a heavy singular case
  (`∫(x·y)^(-1/2)`) drop from ~4.4 MB to ~1.5 MB (−67 %).

### Documentation

- Documented DECUHR's deliberately conservative error estimator: a `MaxIters`
  return code often accompanies a result that is already accurate to better
  than the requested tolerance.

### Validation

- The port was validated **bit-for-bit against the original Fortran `DECUHR`**
  (Espelid & Genz, 1994), compiled locally with gfortran, over six test cases
  with identical parameters: 5 of 6 results match to all 16 significant digits
  (the sixth differs by ~1e-10, pure floating-point reassociation), and the
  `IFAIL` / evaluation counts match on all six. In particular the conservative
  error estimator (a `MaxIters` return code on an already-accurate result) is
  confirmed to be **intrinsic to the algorithm** — the Fortran returns the same
  `IFAIL` — and is therefore documented rather than altered.

### Internal

- Clarified the `BETA`-index clamp in the extrapolation weighted-correction
  branch (a latent off-by-one out-of-bounds in the original Fortran at the
  boundary `UPDATE = N-EMAX`) and hoisted the loop-invariant index.
- Test suite expanded from 9 to 27 assertions (radial singularity, polynomial
  exactness, rule-key sweep, parameter-validation return codes, solution stats,
  ForwardDiff with explicit and auto-estimated `alpha`, small-`emax`
  weighted-correction branch).

## v0.1.1 — Integrals.jl tuple-domain API

### Changed

- Documentation, examples and tests now construct `IntegralProblem`
  with the **tuple-domain** form `IntegralProblem(f, (lb, ub))`
  (and `IntegralProblem(f, (lb, ub), p)` for parameterised integrands).
  The legacy three-positional-argument form `IntegralProblem(f, lb, ub)`
  is no longer supported by Integrals.jl / SciMLBase (≥ 5.4): the upper
  bound `ub` was silently swallowed as the parameter `p` and `lb` alone
  became the domain, so `DecuhrAlgorithm` received scalar bounds and
  raised a `BoundsError`. No change to `DecuhrAlgorithm` or the solver
  itself — only the documented call syntax.

### Compat

- `[compat]` lower bound for `Integrals` raised to `"5.4"` (was `"5"`),
  the line that ships the modern tuple-domain / `ChangeOfVariables`
  domain handling this release targets. `SciMLBase` stays `"2, 3"`:
  DECUHR is exercised on both SciMLBase 2.155 (via MeanFieldHom.jl, whose
  `OrdinaryDiffEq 6` pins SciMLBase 2) and SciMLBase 3.16 (standalone).

## v0.1.0 — Initial release

First public release of DECUHR.jl, hosted on GitHub
(`MicroPoroChemoMechanics/DECUHR.jl`).

Pure-Julia port of the DECUHR algorithm
([Espelid & Genz, *Numerical Algorithms* 8 (1994), 201–220](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02142691))
for automatic adaptive integration of functions with **vertex
singularities** over hyper-rectangular regions.

### Features

- `DecuhrAlgorithm` plugs into the SciML
  [Integrals.jl](https://github.com/SciML/Integrals.jl) solver stack
  via `SciMLBase.AbstractIntegralAlgorithm`.
- Genz–Malik cubature rule plus corner-aware variants
  (`src/rules.jl`).
- Richardson extrapolation on sub-region averages
  (`src/extrapolation.jl`).
- Automatic estimation of the singular strength `α` from the empirical
  decay of sub-region contributions (`src/alpha_estimation.jl`); user
  override available via `DecuhrAlgorithm(; alpha = …)`.
- Adaptive subdivision loop (`src/adaptive.jl`) with configurable
  workspace size (`wrksub`), extrapolation order (`emax`) and minimum
  function-evaluation count (`minpts`).
- 2D and 3D integration; `singul ∈ {1, 2, 3}` selects edge / face /
  corner singularity structure.
- Logarithmic singularity factor `logf ∈ {0, 1, …}`
  (e.g. `f(x) ~ x^α · (-log x)^logf`).
- Vector-valued integrand support.
- ForwardDiff-compatible throughout: gradients propagate through both
  integrand and integration domain when the rule is applied to a
  problem parameterised by `Dual` numbers.

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions workflows: CI, Documentation, Register, CompatHelper,
  Format, TagBot (`.github/workflows/`).
- Multi-version documentation deployment via `docs/deploy_docs.jl`
  (`stable/`, `dev/`, `vX.Y.Z/`).

### Provenance

The Julia port is released under the **MIT** license. The upstream
Fortran package by Espelid & Genz (1994) carries its own copyright
notice, reproduced verbatim in `NOTICE` and in
`docs/src/license.md` — both must travel with any redistribution of
this package.
